## Harmony - A collection of epidemic models. 

I've studied quite a tiny bit of epidemiology and its intersection with evolutionary game theory, so I hope to do some experiments
of my own here. All with the hopes of improving my understanding, reading a bit more and possible educating.

## To do

- ~~Continuous SIR~~
- ~~Discrete SIR~~
- ~~Network discrete SIR~~
- Network SIR with dynamic time step (Gillespie)
- 

## Experiments

- Study how various vaccination policies may affect a population
  - How best to distribute subsidy?
- Studying influence of new disease mitigation strategies
- How varying models of disease influence?
