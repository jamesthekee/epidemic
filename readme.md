## Harmony - The gamers's choice to epidemic modeling

I've studied quite a tiny bit of epidemiology and its intersection with evolutionary game theory, so I hope to do some experiments
of my own here. All with the hopes of improving my understanding, reading a bit more and possible educating. 
So that I have some interesting youtube videos.

For why it's called harmony, well I simply wanted to be like every other cool project with a well branded name.
It's short, simple and simply sounds nice.
