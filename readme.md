## Harmony - The gamers's choice to epidemic modeling

I've studied quite a tiny bit of epidemiology and its intersection with evolutionary game theory, so I hope to do some experiments
of my own here. All with the hopes of improving my understanding, reading a bit more and possible educating. 
So that I have some interesting youtube videos.
